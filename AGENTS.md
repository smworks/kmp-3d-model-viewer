# Agent Guidelines

- Prefer simple, easy-to-read code over clever or overly optimized solutions.
- Avoid comments unless they are extremely necessary; aim for self-explanatory implementations.
- Apply Hungarian notation throughout C++ code.
- Follow Kotlin's official coding conventions for Kotlin sources.
